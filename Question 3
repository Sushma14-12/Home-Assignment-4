Role of Temperature in Text Generation
Temperature scaling affects the randomness of the predictions:

Low temperature (<1.0): makes the model more conservative, choosing high-probability characters. Output is more predictable and repetitive.

High temperature (>1.0): increases diversity, giving a chance to less likely characters. This makes the output more creative, but possibly less coherent.

Temperature = 1.0: keeps the modelâ€™s output probabilities unchanged.
